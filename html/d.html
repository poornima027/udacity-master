    <p>Welcome to Shimla
        Strung out along a 12km ridge, with steep forested hillsides falling away in all directions, the Himachal capital is one of India's most popular hill resorts, buzzing with a happy flow of heat-escaping Indian vacationers. For some visitors the attraction is perusing a dwindling series of relics from Shimla's previous incarnation as the summer capital of British India. Traffic is banned from the central part of town, so walking is pleasant â€“ even when huffing and puffing uphill. The long, winding main street, The Mall, runs east and west just below the spine of the hill. South of it, the maze-like alleys and stairways of the bustling bazaar cascade steeply down to traffic-infested Cart Rd.</p>
